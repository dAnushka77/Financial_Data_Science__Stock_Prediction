# Financial_Data_Science__Stock_Prediction

The project focuses mainly on stock price and overall stock market analysis and its prediction of future stock closing prices using LSTM (long short-term memory networks) - a machine learning model. 
LSTM is a model which is capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems and activity recognition.

To go about the functioning of the project, I have divided the work into 6 main focus areas, which answer the following questions - 

1) Over a period of time, what change or difference in price is depicted by the stock in consideration?
2) What is tentative moving average of a given stock?
3) What is the daily return on an average of a given stock?
4) What is the closing price of a given stock and what is the correlation between any given stocks' closing prices?
5) How much value or amount is risked after investing in a given stock?
6) What will the future closing prices of a given stock be?

The LSTM model built shows 98.2% accuracy for the above given prediction of stock closing prices.
